#Submition for Brackets interview 

Hello, this is my little project. 


Features of my project:
1. Fuzzy search
2. Pagination
3. Responsive design
4. Here are shortcuts for the project:
  cmd/ctrl + k - focus on search input

What is missing:
1. Altough i have button for filters, they are not implemented


Few thing i would like to improve:

1. add better loading animations
2. add better icons
3. add error handling (maybe some error message in modal)
4. better shortcuts

Notes about project:

1. There is a function which calculates id for every character. I know it is not ideal but api for some reason does not return id as single parameter.
